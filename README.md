## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. 
The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream;

## Description
How have you solved the problem?

and C programming language as tool to solve the problem
## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
No Installation run gandalf on your terminal to to check the auto correctness
gcc my_printf.c and ./aout to run the program locally 
## Usage
How does it work?
Each conversion specification is introduced by the PERCENT character. 
The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. After the PERCENT, the following appear in sequence:

doux The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal (d). unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned hexadecimal (x).
c The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
s The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character.
p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
